## My Markdown Notepad

Learning is hard...and one thing I have always struggled with is staying organized. I'm going to use this as a brain dump so other lost programmers might might be able to follow along. I could totally use stack overflow but I'm too lazy to create an account right now. 

Questions:

Should I create a venv for each project in my beginner projects? Or should I just create one venv for all beginner projects? I assume I won't use too many different packages for each one.

Also, what is the bin folder anyway? I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to have Python in there....

Now I've created the game, but how do I ensure that other users can clone and run it?

What a headache.
